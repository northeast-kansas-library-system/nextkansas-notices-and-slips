Dear <<borrowers.firstname>>

<<items.content>>

If you are liable for late fees, remember that late fees increase the longer you keep items overdue.  You may also be charged for the replacement of the item if the item is not returned.  If you feel that this notice is in error, please contact <<branches.branchname>> at <<branches.branchphone>> as soon as possible.  If you would prefer to receive notices such as this one via e-mail, please contact your local library.

If you have returned these items recently, please disregard this e-mail. Due to COVID-19, staff is currently quarantining items for 3 days before they are checked in and we have extended our grace period to seven days, so you will not be charged any late fines if you have already returned theseitems.

You can access your account on-line at https://nextkansas.org 24 hours a day.
Questions?  Please call <<branches.branchphone>> or visit <<branches.branchname>>.
