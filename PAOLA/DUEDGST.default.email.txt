Hello. You have one or more library materials due today. Please renew your materials, or return them to the library. You can renew online at https://nextkansas.org or contact your library for assistance. Thank you.

If you have returned these items recently, please disregard this e-mail. Due to COVID-19, staff is currently quarantining items for 3 days before they are checked in and we have extended our grace period to seven days, so you will not be charged any late fines if you have already returned these items.

Cordially,
