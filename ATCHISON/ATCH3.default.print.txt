According to our records, the library materials you borrowed have not been returned. We must now consider them lost and ask you to pay for their replacement. Your account privileges will remain suspended until all charges are settled with the library.  

<<items.content>>

This is the final notice you will receive for these items. Please note that the library has the legal right to refer past due accounts for unreturned library materials to a collections agency. Contact the library so we can avoid collections proceedings and restore your borrowing privileges. If you need special assistance, please let us know so we can work with you.
