This is a repeated attempt to obtain the listed overdue items.  Your borrowing privileges have been suspended until payment is made or all items are returned.  Please return the items immediately or pay to replace them. There is a book drop in the alley of the library and in the front of the library.  Please remember, we do not charge overdue fines; we would like the items returned.

Library materials are purchased with tax funds and are considered public property. According to K.S.A 21-3702:""Failure to return materials within 30 days following the overdue notice will constitute intent to deprive the library of public property and constitutes grounds for prosecution of misdemeanor theft.""
