Lost Library Items - <<today>>

Hello <<borrowers.firstname>>

Our records show that items you've borrowed from the library have not been returned. Since it is 45 days past the time they were due, we must now consider them lost and ask you to pay for their replacement. If you have any questions, please let us know or contact us if you need special assistance. 

You can view our Circulation Policy on our website at:  http://www.linwoodcommunitylibrary.org/library_card.html. 

As a reminder, here are the items we would like returned:  
<<items.content>>

If you feel that this notice is in error, please contact <<branches.branchname>> at <<branches.branchphone>> as soon as possible. For now, your account has been suspended and the replacement cost has been billed to your account.  

You can access your account on-line at https://nextkansas.org 24 hours a day.
Questions?  Please call <<branches.branchphone>> or visit <<branches.branchname>>. 

This is an automated email, please contact the library directly to discuss your account.
