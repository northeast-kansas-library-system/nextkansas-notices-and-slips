Hello-

This is a courtesy reminder that you have books that are overdue by 35 days. The items that are currently due back are listed below. In case you were not aware of our policy, if your items aren’t returned:

       after 35 days your account will be automatically blocked*
       after 45 days you’ll be charged the replacement cost of the item*

Please don’t let this happen! Return the materials to the library, or contact us if you need special assistance. 

For your convenience, you can renew your items online. You can also set up Advanced Due notices that remind you before your books are due. Call or visit us online for more information: http://www.linwoodcommunitylibrary.org/library_card.html
