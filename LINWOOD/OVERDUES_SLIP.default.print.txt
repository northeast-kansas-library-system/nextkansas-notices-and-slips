	<p>Dear <<borrowers.firstname>>,</p>
        <p> </p>
	<p>This is a friendly reminder that the item(s) that you checked out from Linwood Community Library are now overdue.  We request that you return them to the library as soon as you can.  Just to let you know, if your items are not returned:</p>
     <p>     *After 45 days, you will be charged the replacement cost of the item</p>
 <br />
<p>Please, don't let this happen! Return the materials to the library, or contact us if you need special assistance. 
 <br /> 
<p>Did you know that you can renew your items online and set up Advanced Due notices that remind you before your items are due through your account at https://nextkansas.org/? We also have a drop box on the side of the building for your convenience.  If you are unable to find them, we can work with you to make arrangements to replace the materials so our other patrons can enjoy them as well.</p>

<p>If you wish to receive e-mail reminders in the future, please let the staff know so that we can set that up for you.<br />
