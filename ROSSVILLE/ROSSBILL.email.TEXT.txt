According to our records, the library materials you borrowed have not been returned. We must now consider them lost and ask you to pay for their replacement. Your account privileges will remain suspended until all charges are settled with the library.  

You may call us at (785) 584-6454 to receive a detailed description of the items/fines you have on your account. 

We will attempt to send you a letter by mail as well, but we may not have a valid address for you. Please note that the library has the legal right to refer past due accounts for unreturned library materials to a collections agency. Contact the library so we can avoid collections proceedings and restore your borrowing privileges. If you need special assistance, please let us know so we can work with you.
