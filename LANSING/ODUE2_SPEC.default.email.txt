Second Overdue Notice - <<today>>

Dear <<borrowers.firstname>>

This is a courtesy reminder that your items are overdue by  35 days. The items that are currently due back are listed below. Just to let you know, if your items are not returned:

     *after 35 days your account will be automatically blocked
     *after 45 days you'll be charged the replacement cost of the item

Please don't let this happen! Return the items to the library, or contact us if you need special assistance. 

<<items.content>>

Did you know you can renew items online? Or that you can set up Advanced Due notices that remind you before your items are due through your account? You can access your account on-line at https://nextkansas.org 24 hours a day.
Questions?  Please call <<branches.branchphone>> or visit <<branches.branchname>>. 

Thank you for using Lansing Community Library!

.pgend.
