Silver lake Public Library
Festival of Mini Trees

The Festival of Mini Trees will be on display at the Silver Lake Library beginning on December 1st. These trees have been donated and decorated by local businesses, civic groups, and individuals.   Anyone can bid on the trees at our Silent Auction between December 1st and December 18th.  Please support your local library by bidding on a tree of your choice.

We will be open until 6:30 P.M., the night of Monday, December 7th so that people may view and bid on trees before Silver Lake’s 5th Annual Holiday Lighting Ceremony.

Listed below are the following mini tree participants:
